# LeadLoss-Plotting
# Additional Code for "Turning Trash into Treasure: Extracting Meaning from Discordant Data via a Dedicated Application"

This repository contains additional Python scripts used to analyze and visualize the output from the LeadLoss application for the manuscript **"Turning Trash into Treasure: Extracting Meaning from Discordant Data via a Dedicated Application"**.

These scripts include functionality for plotting histograms, KDEs, CDFs, and performing statistical comparisons using output files generated by the LeadLoss application.

## Contents

### Files:
1. **montecarlocomparison.py**  
   - Plots KDEs and histograms for Monte Carlo simulations of Pb-loss age distributions.
   - Calculates optimal bandwidth for KDEs, detects peaks, and computes uncertainties through bootstrapping.
   - Includes cumulative distribution function (CDF) inset plots for additional comparison.

2. **stepsizecomparison.py**  
   - Compares Pb-loss age distributions for different step sizes.
   - Plots histograms, KDEs, and CDFs with bootstrapped uncertainties.
   - Performs pairwise Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests for statistical comparisons.

3. **rangecomparison.py**  
   - Analyzes the effect of changing Pb-loss age range on results.
   - Generates KDEs, histograms, and CDF plots to illustrate range sensitivity.
   - Reports peak positions and uncertainties for different ranges.

4. **penalisationcomparison.py**  
   - Compares penalised and non-penalised Pb-loss age models.
   - Generates overlaid histograms and KDEs, including uncertainty visualizations.
   - Outputs variance, standard deviation, and confidence intervals for both models.

5. **pbLossHistogram_individual_Mt_Isa.py**  
   - Plots histogram and KDE for an individual dataset.
